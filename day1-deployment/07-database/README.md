# üóÑÔ∏è Day 1: Database Setup & Migration - Production Blueprint

> **Part 4** of the Kubernetes Day 1 Production Series

## Introduction

Welcome to **Part 4** of our Kubernetes Day 1 series! If you've been following along, you've mastered infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD pipelines, and now it's time to tackle one of the most critical‚Äîand nerve-wracking‚Äîcomponents of any production deployment: **databases**.

While your application pods can scale horizontally and recover from failures with relative ease, databases remain the **stateful heart** of your system. A misconfigured database migration, an overlooked replication lag, or inadequate connection pooling can bring your entire Day 1 deployment to a grinding halt‚Äîor worse, corrupt production data.

In this guide, we'll walk through the complete database provisioning and migration strategy used in our **healthcare platform migration** (the real-world example threaded throughout this series). We'll cover everything from managed RDS provisioning to schema migration automation, high availability configuration, and the critical validation steps that ensure your data layer is production-ready.

## 0. Prerequisites & Database Team Roles

### 0.1 Prerequisites

Before diving into database provisioning, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ **Database credentials vault** configured (AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault / HashiCorp Vault)
- ‚úÖ **Network security groups** allowing database traffic from Kubernetes subnets
- ‚úÖ **Backup storage** buckets/volumes provisioned and accessible
- ‚úÖ **Schema migration scripts** version-controlled and peer-reviewed
- ‚úÖ **Connection string templates** prepared for each environment
- ‚úÖ **Database monitoring dashboards** pre-configured in Grafana
- ‚úÖ **Rollback database snapshots** from Day 0 testing
- ‚úÖ **Data masking tools** if dealing with PII/PHI (production-like test data)

### 0.2 Database Team Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Core Responsibility |
|------|---------------------|
| **DBA Lead** | Schema design, migration execution, performance tuning |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Infrastructure-as-Code provisioning, secret injection, GitOps integration |
| **Application Team** | Connection pool configuration, query optimization, health probe validation |
| **Security Engineer** | Encryption at rest/transit, access control, audit logging |
| **Data Engineer** | ETL pipeline integration, data lake connectivity, analytics read replicas |
| **Compliance Officer** | HIPAA/GDPR validation, data retention policies, audit trails |

## 1. Database Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Why Managed Databases for Day 1?

In production Kubernetes deployments, we **strongly recommend** managed database services (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database) over self-hosted StatefulSets for Day 1.

**Managed Database Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- ‚úÖ Multi-AZ replication with automatic failover
- ‚úÖ Patch management handled by cloud provider
- ‚úÖ Performance Insights and query analytics built-in
- ‚úÖ Encryption at rest enabled by default
- ‚úÖ Connection pooling (RDS Proxy / AlloyDB Auth Proxy)
- ‚úÖ Scalable storage with minimal downtime

### 1.2 Healthcare Platform Database Topology

See [architecture diagram](./docs/architecture-diagram.md) for our multi-tier database setup with RDS Proxy connection pooling.

## Quick Start

### Deploy Database Infrastructure

```bash
# AWS RDS PostgreSQL
cd terraform/aws-rds
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=production.tfvars

# Validate infrastructure
./scripts/validate-database-infra.sh
```

### Execute Schema Migration

```bash
# Apply Flyway migration
kubectl apply -f k8s/flyway-migration-job.yaml

# Monitor progress
kubectl logs -f job/flyway-migration -n database

# Validate migration
./scripts/execute-migration.sh
```

### Test High Availability

```bash
# Test Multi-AZ failover
./scripts/test-database-failover.sh

# Validate connection pooling
kubectl exec -it deploy/api-server -n production -- \
  curl http://localhost:9090/metrics | grep db_pool
```

## Real-World Healthcare Platform Results

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Total Downtime** | <4 hours | 3h 47min | ‚úÖ |
| **Data Migration Time** | <90 min | 78 min | ‚úÖ |
| **Schema Migration** | <30 min | 18 min | ‚úÖ |
| **Data Integrity** | 100% | 100% | ‚úÖ |
| **Query Performance** | No regression | 23% improvement | ‚úÖ |
| **Failed Transactions** | <0.01% | 0% | ‚úÖ |
