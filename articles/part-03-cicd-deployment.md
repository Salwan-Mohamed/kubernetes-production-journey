# Code Deployment & CI/CD Activation: From Git Push to Production

## The Midnight Rollback

It was 12:47 AM. Marcus, a DevOps engineer at a fast-growing SaaS company, watched in horror as their dashboard lit up like a Christmas tree—but not the good kind. Red alerts. Cascading failures. Customer support channels exploding.

They had just deployed version 2.3.0 of their payment service to production. The CI/CD pipeline was green. All tests passed. The staging environment looked perfect. Code review? Four approvals from senior engineers.

**But production was burning.**

Orders were failing. API latency jumped from 120ms to 8 seconds. Database connections were maxing out. The on-call phone started ringing. Then the CEO's Slack message appeared: "Why can't customers check out?"

Marcus hit the rollback button. Nothing happened. The ArgoCD UI showed "Sync Failed." The previous deployment had accidentally deleted a critical ConfigMap. The rollback tried to deploy an image that no longer existed in their registry (someone had "cleaned up old images" that afternoon).

**They were stuck. In production. At midnight. With no way back.**

It took 3 hours of manual kubectl commands, database connection pool tweaking, and emergency hotfixes to stabilize. The incident cost $127K in lost revenue, damaged their reputation, and prompted an all-hands post-mortem.

**The problem wasn't the code. It was the deployment process.**

Welcome to **Code Deployment & CI/CD Activation**—where your carefully crafted infrastructure meets the chaos of continuous delivery.

## Why CI/CD Makes or Breaks Day 1

You've built the perfect Kubernetes infrastructure. Your network is bulletproof. Your storage is fast. Your monitoring is comprehensive.

**None of it matters if you can't safely deploy code.**

CI/CD is the bridge between development and production. It's how your team's work reaches customers. Get it right, and deploys become routine, boring, and safe. Get it wrong, and every release is a high-stakes gamble.

### The Deployment Paradox

Modern software teams face a contradiction:

**On one hand:**
- Deploy frequently (daily, even hourly)
- Move fast (ship features quickly)
- Stay competitive (beat rivals to market)

**On the other hand:**
- Zero downtime (customers expect 99.99% uptime)
- Zero bugs in production (mistakes cost money and trust)
- Zero stress (engineers want weekends back)

**The solution:** A CI/CD pipeline so reliable and automated that deploys become as safe as clicking "refresh" in your browser.

## The FinanceHub Platform: Our Real-World Example

Throughout this article, we'll follow **"FinanceHub"** (name changed), a financial analytics platform processing 2 million transactions daily for 50,000 users.

### The Requirements

**Business requirements:**
- **20+ deploys per day** (across 30 microservices)
- **Zero customer-facing downtime**
- **Instant rollback** (under 60 seconds)
- **SOC 2 compliance** (audit trails, approvals, secrets management)
- **Multi-region deployment** (US, EU, Asia)

**Technical constraints:**
- **3 environments** (dev, staging, production)
- **30 microservices** (various languages: Go, Python, Node.js)
- **GitOps methodology** (ArgoCD)
- **Progressive delivery** (canary deployments, blue-green)
- **6 database migrations** per week average
- **Team of 15 developers** (varying skill levels)

**The challenge:** Build a CI/CD system that lets developers ship confidently without needing to understand Kubernetes internals.

## Phase 1: CI/CD Architecture Overview

Before writing any pipelines, understand the full deployment lifecycle:

### The Six Stages of Safe Deployment

```
1. BUILD         → Compile code, build container images
2. TEST          → Unit, integration, security tests
3. SCAN          → Vulnerability scanning, policy checks
4. PUBLISH       → Push images to registry, tag properly
5. DEPLOY        → GitOps sync to cluster
6. VALIDATE      → Health checks, smoke tests, rollout verification
```

**Each stage is a gate. Fail any gate? Deployment stops.**

### FinanceHub's Architecture

```
GitHub Repository
    ↓
GitHub Actions (CI Pipeline)
    ├─→ Build Docker Images
    ├─→ Run Tests (Unit + Integration)
    ├─→ Security Scan (Trivy + Snyk)
    ├─→ Push to ECR
    └─→ Update GitOps Repo (Image Tags)
         ↓
GitOps Repository (Kustomize + Helm)
    ↓
ArgoCD (CD Controller)
    ├─→ Sync to Dev Cluster (Auto)
    ├─→ Sync to Staging (Auto after tests)
    └─→ Sync to Production (Manual approval + Canary)
         ↓
Kubernetes Clusters (Multi-Region)
    ├─→ US-EAST
    ├─→ EU-WEST
    └─→ ASIA-SOUTHEAST
         ↓
Argo Rollouts (Progressive Delivery)
    ├─→ Canary 10% → 30% → 50% → 100%
    └─→ Auto-rollback on errors
```

**Key principle:** Developers push to `main`. Automation handles everything else.

## Phase 2: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

### The Build Pipeline

FinanceHub's build pipeline runs on every push to any branch. Here's a condensed version showing the key stages:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: ['**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  ECR_REGISTRY: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  IMAGE_NAME: financehub/api-gateway

jobs:
  # Job 1: Code Quality & Tests
  quality-and-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
      
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: |
          go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
          COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
          if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | bc -l) )); then
            echo "❌ Coverage ${COVERAGE}% below 80% threshold"
            exit 1
          fi

  # Job 2: Build & Push Docker Image
  build-and-push:
    needs: quality-and-tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      image-tag: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          cache-from: type=gha

  # Job 3: Security Scanning
  security-scan:
    needs: build-and-push
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          image-ref: ${{ needs.build-and-push.outputs.image-tag }}
          severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
          exit-code: '1'

  # Job 4: Update GitOps Repository
  update-gitops:
    needs: [build-and-push, security-scan]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update image tag
        run: |
          cd gitops/environments/dev
          kustomize edit set image \
            ${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}=${{ needs.build-and-push.outputs.image-tag }}
```

**Pipeline execution time:** ~8 minutes from push to dev deployment

### Base Deployment with Proper Health Probes

```yaml
# base/api-gateway/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-gateway
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0  # Zero downtime
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
      
      containers:
        - name: api-gateway
          image: api-gateway:latest
          
          # CRITICAL: Proper health probes
          startupProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/startup
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 0
            periodSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 30
          
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/live
              port: 8080
            periodSeconds: 10
            failureThreshold: 3
          
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health/ready
              port: 8080
            periodSeconds: 5
            failureThreshold: 2
          
          # Resource limits (prevent resource exhaustion)
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 500m
              memory: 512Mi
          
          # Security context
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
            capabilities:
              drop: ["ALL"]
```

---

## Phase 4: ArgoCD Configuration

### Application Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-prod
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: production
  
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/financehub/gitops-repo
    targetRevision: main
    path: environments/production/us-east
  
  destination:
    server: https://prod-us-east.k8s.local
    namespace: production
  
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    retry:
      limit: 5
      backoff:
        duration: 5s
        maxDuration: 3m
```

---

## Phase 5: Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts

### Canary Deployment Strategy

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: api-gateway
spec:
  replicas: 10
  strategy:
    canary:
      canaryService: api-gateway-canary
      stableService: api-gateway-stable
      
      steps:
        # Step 1: Deploy canary, route 10% traffic
        - setWeight: 10
        - pause: {duration: 5m}
        
        # Step 2: Increase to 30%
        - setWeight: 30
        - pause: {duration: 5m}
        
        # Step 3: Increase to 50%
        - setWeight: 50
        - pause: {}  # Manual approval required
        
        # Step 4: Full rollout
        - setWeight: 100
      
      # Automated analysis
      analysis:
        templates:
          - templateName: success-rate
          - templateName: latency-p99
```

### Analysis Template

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: success-rate
spec:
  metrics:
    - name: success-rate
      interval: 1m
      successCondition: result >= 0.95
      failureLimit: 3
      provider:
        prometheus:
          address: http://prometheus:9090
          query: |
            sum(rate(http_requests_total{status!~"5.."}[5m]))
            /
            sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

**Result:** Automatic rollback if success rate drops below 95%

---

## Phase 6: Secrets Management

### External Secrets Operator

```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: api-gateway-secrets
spec:
  refreshInterval: 1h
  secretStoreRef:
    name: aws-secretsmanager
    kind: ClusterSecretStore
  
  target:
    name: api-gateway-secrets
  
  data:
    - secretKey: db.password
      remoteRef:
        key: prod/api-gateway/db
        property: password
```

**Never store secrets in Git!**

---

## Phase 7: Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback

Argo Rollouts automatically rolls back if:
- Success rate drops below 95%
- P99 latency exceeds 1 second
- Analysis fails 3 times

```bash
# Check rollout status
kubectl argo rollouts status api-gateway -n production

# Manual approval to proceed
kubectl argo rollouts promote api-gateway -n production
```

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# emergency-rollback.sh

echo "🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK"

# Scale down current deployment
kubectl scale deployment/api-gateway --replicas=0 -n production

# Deploy last known good version
kubectl set image deployment/api-gateway \
  api-gateway=ecr.amazonaws.com/api-gateway:stable-last-good \
  -n production

# Scale up
kubectl scale deployment/api-gateway --replicas=10 -n production

echo "✅ Emergency rollback complete"
```

## Common CI/CD Mistakes

### Mistake #1: No Health Probes
**Problem:** Kubernetes routes traffic before pods are ready  
**Fix:** Configure startup, liveness, and readiness probes

### Mistake #2: Missing Resource Limits
**Problem:** Bad deployment consumes all cluster resources  
**Fix:** Set requests and limits on every container

### Mistake #3: Manual Image Tags
**Problem:** "latest" tag causes unpredictable deployments  
**Fix:** Use semantic versioning or SHA-based tags

### Mistake #4: No Rollback Strategy
**Problem:** Can't recover from bad deployments  
**Fix:** Progressive delivery + automated analysis

### Mistake #5: Secrets in Git
**Problem:** Sensitive data exposed  
**Fix:** External Secrets Operator or Sealed Secrets

### Mistake #6: No Approval Gates
**Problem:** Broken code reaches production  
**Fix:** Manual approval + progressive rollout

### Mistake #7: Insufficient Testing
**Problem:** Bugs caught in production  
**Fix:** Comprehensive tests + staging environment

**But there's one critical dependency: databases.**

In the next article:

**Part 4: Database Setup & Migration**
- RDS provisioning for multi-region
- Schema migrations with zero downtime
- High availability and failover
- Backup and point-in-time recovery
- Connection pool management

We'll walk through FinanceHub's database migration that handled 2 million transactions without a single failure.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Automation prevents mistakes** - Humans fail at repetitive tasks
2. **GitOps creates audit trails** - Every change in Git history
3. **Progressive delivery reduces risk** - Catch issues at 10%, not 100%
4. **Health probes save production** - Kubernetes needs them to route smartly
5. **Secrets never belong in Git** - Use External Secrets Operator
6. **Rollback must be instant** - < 60 seconds or lose customers
7. **Test everything** - Untested code is broken code
