## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Cloud High Availability

**Use Case**: Financial services, critical applications

**Architecture**:
- Primary: AWS EKS (us-east-1, us-west-2)
- Secondary: Azure AKS (eastus, westus)
- Global load balancing with Route53 / Traffic Manager
- Cross-cloud service mesh

### Pattern 2: Hybrid Cloud

**Use Case**: Enterprise with on-premises investment

**Architecture**:
- On-premises: vSphere with Tanzu
- Cloud: GCP GKE for burst capacity
- VPN/Direct Connect for connectivity
- Federated identity management

### Pattern 3: Edge Computing

**Use Case**: IoT, retail, distributed applications

**Architecture**:
- Core: AWS EKS (multi-region)
- Edge: K3s on ARM devices
- Centralized management with Rancher
- Edge-optimized data sync

## üìä Capacity Planning Guidelines

### Node Sizing Formula

```
Required Nodes = (Peak RPS √ó Avg Response Time √ó Safety Factor) / (Node vCPU √ó CPU Efficiency)

Where:
- Peak RPS = Peak Requests Per Second
- Avg Response Time = Application response time in seconds
- Safety Factor = 1.5-2.0 (for overhead and spikes)
- Node vCPU = vCPUs per node
- CPU Efficiency = 0.6-0.8 (realistic utilization)
```

### Example Calculation

```
Peak RPS: 10,000
Avg Response Time: 0.1s
Safety Factor: 1.5
Node vCPU: 8
CPU Efficiency: 0.7

Required Nodes = (10,000 √ó 0.1 √ó 1.5) / (8 √ó 0.7) = 268 vCPUs ‚âà 34 nodes
```

## üîê Security Design Principles

1. **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum permissions required
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: No runtime changes
5. **Audit Everything**: Complete audit trail

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategies

### From Day 0

1. **Right-size from the start**: Don't over-provision
2. **Use spot instances**: For fault-tolerant workloads
3. **Implement autoscaling**: Scale down during low traffic
4. **Reserved capacity**: For predictable baseline
5. **Storage lifecycle**: Auto-delete old logs/backups

---

## üìã Documentation Templates

All templates are in their respective directories:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Capacity planning spreadsheets
- Security threat models
- Cost estimation workbooks
- Migration wave plans

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

You're ready for Day 1 when:

‚úÖ Architecture is documented and reviewed
‚úÖ Capacity planning is validated
‚úÖ Security controls are designed
‚úÖ Costs are estimated and approved
‚úÖ Team roles are defined

‚úÖ Runbooks are drafted

---

## üîó Next Steps

Once Day 0 is complete:

1. Review all documentation with stakeholders
2. Get budget approval
3. Set up development environment
4. Validate design with PoC
5. Proceed to [Day 1 Deployment](../day1-deployment/README.md)
